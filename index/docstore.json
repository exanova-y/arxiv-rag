While large language\nmodels (LLMs) have shown promise as autonomous agents in simulated IR settings,\ntheir reasoning is often limited by a lack of access to external knowledge. In\nthis work, we present AutoBnB-RAG, an extension of the AutoBnB framework that\nincorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into multi-agent incident\nresponse simulations. Built on the Backdoors & Breaches (B&B) tabletop game\nenvironment, AutoBnB-RAG enables agents to issue retrieval queries and\nincorporate external evidence during collaborative investigations. We introduce\ntwo retrieval settings: one grounded in curated technical documentation\n(RAG-Wiki), and another using narrative-style incident reports (RAG-News). We\nevaluate performance across eight team structures, including newly introduced\nargumentative configurations designed to promote critical reasoning. To\nvalidate practical utility, we also simulate real-world cyber incidents based\non public breach reports, demonstrating AutoBnB-RAG's ability to reconstruct\ncomplex multi-stage attacks. Our results show that retrieval augmentation\nimproves decision quality and success rates across diverse organizational\nmodels. This work demonstrates the value of integrating retrieval mechanisms\ninto LLM-based multi-agent systems for cybersecurity decision-making.\nPublished: 2025-08-18 17:22:51+00:00\nJournal Reference: None\nDOI: None\nPrimary Category: cs.CL\nCategories: cs.CL, cs.CR\nPDF URL: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13118v1\narXiv URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13118v1", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1780, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff11a212-6089-4580-bde3-4c3c2653ab4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff11a212-6089-4580-bde3-4c3c2653ab4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a298e2f6-dbf6-420d-b6bc-e1c3299e3537", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b2d2609d0c6f79a48a35942843a7dec16ebaf9e2743aa1d27b0001cea48e836", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Title: The Application of Transformer-Based Models for Predicting Consequences of Cyber Attacks\nAuthors: Bipin Chhetri, Akbar Siami Namin\nSummary: Cyberattacks are increasing, and securing against such threats is costing\nindustries billions of dollars annually. Threat Modeling, that is,\ncomprehending the consequences of these attacks, can provide critical support\nto cybersecurity professionals, enabling them to take timely action and\nallocate resources that could be used elsewhere. Cybersecurity is heavily\ndependent on threat modeling, as it assists security experts in assessing and\nmitigating risks related to identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Recently,\nthere has been a pressing need for automated methods to assess attack\ndescriptions and forecast the future consequences of the increasing complexity\nof cyberattacks. This study examines how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and\ndeep learning can be applied to analyze the potential impact of cyberattacks by\nleveraging textual descriptions from the MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration\n(CWE) database. We emphasize classifying attack consequences into five\nprincipal categories: Availability, Access Control, Confidentiality, Integrity,\nand Other. This paper investigates the use of Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) in combination with Hierarchical\nAttention Networks (HANs) for Multi-label classification, evaluating their\nperformance in comparison with conventional CNN and LSTM-based models.\nExperimental findings show that BERT achieves an overall accuracy of $0.972$,\nfar higher than conventional deep learning models in multi-label\nclassification. HAN outperforms baseline forms of CNN and LSTM-based models on\nspecific cybersecurity labels. However, BERT consistently achieves better\nprecision and recall, making it more suitable for predicting the consequences\nof a cyberattack.\nPublished: 2025-08-18 15:46:36+00:00\nJournal Reference: None\nDOI: None\nPrimary Category: cs.LG\nCategories: cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR\nPDF URL: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13030v1\narXiv URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13030v1", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2097, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbe7af5b-272c-4156-a953-de1a4fb10eba": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbe7af5b-272c-4156-a953-de1a4fb10eba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c9fb8fc7-d134-43cb-834e-169e0b9a4ae6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f3810051208255d687e9253f02501924634ad93f9a63c6ac3804954f80ff9d53", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Title: Prescriptive Zero Trust- Assessing the impact of zero trust on cyber attack prevention\nAuthors: Samuel Aiello\nSummary: Increasingly sophisticated and varied cyber threats necessitate ever\nimproving enterprise security postures. For many organizations today, those\npostures have a foundation in the Zero Trust Architecture. This strategy sees\ntrust as something an enterprise must not give lightly or assume too broadly.\nUnderstanding the ZTA and its numerous controls centered around the idea of not\ntrusting anything inside or outside the network without verification, will\nallow organizations to comprehend and leverage this increasingly common\nparadigm. The ZTA, unlike many other regulatory frameworks, is not tightly\ndefined. The research assesses the likelihood of quantifiable guidelines that\nmeasure cybersecurity maturity for an enterprise organization in relation to\nZTA implementation. This is a new, data driven methodology for quantifying\ncyber resilience enabled by the adoption of Zero Trust principles to\npragmatically address the critical need of organizations. It also looks at the\npractical aspects ZTA has on capabilities in deterring cyberattacks on a\nnetwork. The outcomes of this research define a prescriptive set of key\ntechnical controls across identity verification, microsegmentation, data\nencryption, analytics, and orchestration that characterize the comprehensive\nZTA deployment. By evaluating the depth of integration for each control\ncomponent and aligning to industry best practices, the study's results help\nassess an organization's ZTA maturity level on a scale from Initial to\nOptimized adoption. The research's resultant four tier model demarcates phases\nfor an organization on its security transformation journey, with each tier\nadding to the capability of the last.\nPublished: 2025-08-18 14:30:00+00:00\nJournal Reference: None\nDOI: None\nPrimary Category: cs.CR\nCategories: cs.CR\nPDF URL: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12953v1\narXiv URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12953v1", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2013, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}}
